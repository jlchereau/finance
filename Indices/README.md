#4 – Healthy Current Ratio

Another important criterion for picking stocks depends on the company’s liquidity ratio. If the company’s debt is more, it indicates a near-to-bankruptcy situation. Therefore, it is necessary to have a current ratio of more than 1.5 times. 

#5 – Good Financial Leverage 

A good leverage indicates that the firm has more assets than the debt owed. Therefore, Graham suggested stocks that have financial leverage (debt-to-current asset) of less than 1.1. 

Strategies

Let us look at the strategies for the stock selection for a better understanding:

#1 – Top-Down Selection Approach 

In financial markets, a top-down strategy refers to a macro view of the entire market. Starting from a nation’s economy to industries, sectors, and finally to individual companies. Investors try to take a sky view of the stock market and pick the appropriate ones. One of the biggest flexes is that there is a real analysis of the entire economy. As a result, they tend to select the right ones in their portfolio. 

#2 – Bottom-Up Stock Selection

Bottom-up stock selection is the opposite of the top-down approach. While the latter has a macro view, the former provides a microscopic view of the process. Here, the investor tries to build a staircase using companies as the initial step. This approach helps in finding fundamentally strong stocks. Later, the analysis moves ahead toward segregation into sectors and industries. First, however, the companies are chosen on various fundamentals. Then, in the end, the economic factors are considered. 

Asset Allocation vs Stock Selection

Although asset allocation and stock selection are pillars of the same base, they have quite distinctions between them. So, let us look at their differences:

Purpose	To pick appropriate stocks that will provide high returns in the future.	To precisely segregate all the funds into different asset classes.

Strategy type	Both (Bottom-up and top-down approach )	Top-to-down stock selection approach. 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

What is stock selection risk?
It is the risk associated with choosing specific stocks for investment in a portfolio.
